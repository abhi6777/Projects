Q1. What is RDBMS? Why do industries use RDBMS?

Ans:- RDBMS stands for relationship database management system . It establishes relation with different table using sturucture query language. 
industries use rdbms for stuructured data , data integrity, security,relationship, powerful querying, etc features.


Q2. Explain the relationship data model in depth.

Ans:- It is a way of organizing data into tables, in a row column sturucture, each table has primary key , alternate keys, . All the data establishes relation between one another . 

Types of Relationships:
One-to-One (1:1)
Each row in A ↔️ one row in B

e.g., Person ↔️ Passport

One-to-Many (1:N)
One row in A ↔️ multiple rows in B

e.g., Customer ↔️ Orders

Many-to-Many (M:N)
Rows in A ↔️ many in B and vice versa (need junction table)

e.g., Students ↔️ Courses


Q3. What is the importance of Relationships in a Database management system? Explain the types
of relationships.

Ans:- Relationships connects the different entity altogether which helps in easy data connection and retrievals . 

There are mainly 4 types of entity relationship 
1.> one to one 

2.> one to many 

3.> many to one 

4.> many to many

Q4. Explain the different types of Keys in RDBMS considering a real-life scenario.

Ans:- so there are mainly 6 types of keys 

1.> Primary Key – Unique ID for each record (like your passport number).

2.> Candidate Key – Potential primary keys (all your unique IDs, passport, driver’s license).

3.> Composite Key – Combination of keys to identify a record (like your first name + birthdate if alone isn’t unique).

4.> Foreign Key – Links to a primary key in another table (like your college ID linked to your department).

5.> Alternate Key – Candidate keys not chosen as primary (your driver’s license if passport is primary).

6.> Artificial Key – System-generated key, not based on real data (like an auto-incremented ID).

Q5. Write a short note on Single Responsibility Principle.

Ans:- In RDBMS, Single Responsibility Principle means each table is responsible for storing data related to one specific entity or purpose.

Q6. Explain the different types of errors that could arise in a denormalized database.

Ans:- different types of errors in denormalized database are :-

1.> insertion anomaly
2.> deletion anomaly
3.> Update anomaly


Q7. What is normalization and what is the need for normalization?

Ans:- Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It’s needed to avoid anomalies and keep data consistent.


Q8. List out the different levels of Normalization and explain them in detail.

Ans:- The different types of normalization are:- 
1.> 1NF = The shell should not contain multiple values. 
The table should have a primary key.
No repeating groups.

2.> 2NF = The table must be in 1NF.
The table should not have any partial functional dependency.

3.> 3NF = The table must be in 2NF.
The table should not have any transitive dependency (a>b>c)

4.> BCNF =The table must be in 3NF.
every determinant is a candidate key.

5.> 4NF = Deals with multi-valued dependencies (rare, advanced).

6.> 5Nf =  Deals with join dependencies (super advanced, often ignored).


Q9. What are joins and why do we need them?

Ans:- Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns.
We need them to fetch complete data that’s spread across multiple tables.

Q10. Explain the different types of joins?

Ans:- There are mainly four types of join 
INNER JOIN – Returns only matching rows.

LEFT JOIN – All rows from left table + matched rows from right.

RIGHT JOIN – All rows from right table + matched rows from left.

FULL JOIN – All rows when there’s a match in either table.
